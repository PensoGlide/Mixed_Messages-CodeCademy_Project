# Mixed Messages - A CodeCaemy Project

This repository contains my take on the "Mixed Messages" project from the Full-Stack Developer path provided at CodeCademy. This code is written on *JavaScript* and is intended to be run at the Terminal ( on a *bash shell*, specifically).

## Objective and how to run:

The sole purpose, as of yet, is for the `code.js` to spit out a quote from Albert Einstein. To run it, simply:

1. Download the repository in a directory of your choosing;
2. Open the Terminal;
3. Change path to directory where the repository is placed;
4. Write on the Terminal >`node code.js`;
5. Et voil√°! There you have your quote!

## Original thought:
I first inteded to make this code read from a `.json` file to use many more quotes from different people and use eventually output the quotes via email. I hope that further along this course I will learn to do this.
